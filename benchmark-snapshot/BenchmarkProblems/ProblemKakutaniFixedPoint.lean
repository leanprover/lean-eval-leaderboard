# Kakutani fixed-point theorem

§33 of Oliver Knill's *Some Fundamental Theorems in Mathematics* (an
additional statement in the section on game theory; Nash's 1951 proof of
equilibrium existence uses Kakutani directly). The set-valued
generalization of Brouwer: every upper-hemicontinuous correspondence from
a nonempty compact convex `K ⊆ ℝᵈ` to itself with nonempty convex closed
values has a fixed point `x ∈ F x`.

mathlib has Brouwer-related lattices/logics under `grep -ri kakutani` only
the Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem for positive functionals
— a different theorem entirely. The fixed-point theorem itself is not in
mathlib.

/-- A correspondence `F : α → Set β` is **upper hemicontinuous** in the
closed-graph sense if its graph `{(x, y) | y ∈ F x}` is closed in `α × β`.
For closed-valued maps into a compact space this coincides with the
sequential/topological definition. -/
