/-- The absolute constant such that for all `k ≥ k₀`, the theorem holds.

Part of the theorem statement is that `k₀` should be "effectively computable".
In principle, this means that the definition of `k₀` should avoid `Classical.choice`.
Unfortunately, this is not currently enforceable in Comparator.
Note that prohibiting `noncomputable` is not sufficient:

Statement of Theorem 2:

There is an effectively computable absolute constant `k₀` such
that if `k ≥ k₀` is a positive integer, then any `Solution` with prime exponent `l` satisfies
either `y = 0` or `d = 0` or `l ≤ exp(10 ^ k)`.
