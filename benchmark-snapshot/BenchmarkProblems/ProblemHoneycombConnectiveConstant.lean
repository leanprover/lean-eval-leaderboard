# The connective constant of the honeycomb lattice

Duminil-Copin and Smirnov proved Nienhuis's prediction that the connective
constant of the honeycomb (hexagonal) lattice is `sqrt (2 + sqrt 2)`.

The lattice is represented in bipartite integer coordinates. A vertex
`(x, y, false)` is adjacent to `(x, y, true)`, `(x - 1, y, true)`, and
`(x, y - 1, true)`; the reverse moves apply on the other side. Thus a
finite direction word determines a walk, and injectivity of its sequence
of visited vertices is exactly the self-avoiding condition.
