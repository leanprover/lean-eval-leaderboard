# Main Statements from On the Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture

We formalise the statements of the main results from D. Koukoulopoulos and J. Maynard,
`On the Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture`, Annals of Math, 192 (1) 2020.

## Implementation Details

In the paper, `ℕ` denotes the positive integers, which are denoted `ℕ+` in Lean.
Hence, no changes to the domains of the functions `ψ` and `ψ⋆` have been made in the formalisation.
