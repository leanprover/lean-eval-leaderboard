# The Newlander–Nirenberg theorem

An almost complex structure whose Nijenhuis tensor vanishes is integrable:
near every point there are local coordinates in which the structure is the
standard one on `ℂⁿ`.

The content is local, so as with Darboux's theorem the statement lives on
an open set `U ⊆ ℝ^{2n}`. An almost complex structure on `U` is a smooth field
`J : U → End(ℝ^{2n})` with `J² = -1`; its Nijenhuis tensor is

  `N(V, W) = [JV, JW] - J[JV, W] - J[V, JW] - [V, W]`,

written with mathlib's `VectorField.lieBracket`. Because `N` is tensorial it
is enough to test it on globally smooth vector fields. The conclusion produces
a holomorphic coordinate chart: a local diffeomorphism `φ` onto an open subset
of `ℂⁿ` whose differential is complex linear, `dφ ∘ J = i · dφ`. Transition
maps between two such charts are then automatically biholomorphic, so the
charts make `U` a complex manifold inducing `J`.

mathlib has the Lie bracket of vector fields, `ContDiffOn`, `fderiv`,
`EuclideanSpace` and `OpenPartialHomeomorph`, but no almost complex
structures, no Nijenhuis tensor, and no Newlander–Nirenberg theorem. No
formalization of the theorem was found in any other proof assistant.

/-- The **Nijenhuis tensor** of a field of endomorphisms `J` on `ℝ^{2n}`,
evaluated on two vector fields `V`, `W` at a point:

  `N(V, W) = [JV, JW] - J[JV, W] - J[V, JW] - [V, W]`.

For an almost complex structure the last term is `J²[V, W]`, so this is the
usual torsion of `J`. When `U` is open and `IsAlmostComplexOn J U` holds, the
expression is `C^∞(U)`-bilinear in `V` and `W` on `U`: the terms involving the
derivatives of `V` and `W` cancel using `J² = -1`, so the value at a point of
`U` depends only on `V x`, `W x` and the derivative of `J` there. -/

/-- The Nijenhuis tensor of `J` vanishes on `U`. This is stated for all
globally smooth vector fields, which is the textbook hypothesis. Whenever `U`
is open and `IsAlmostComplexOn J U` holds it is equivalent to the pointwise
condition: the tensor is bilinear over functions, and constant vector fields
already realize every pair of tangent vectors. -/
