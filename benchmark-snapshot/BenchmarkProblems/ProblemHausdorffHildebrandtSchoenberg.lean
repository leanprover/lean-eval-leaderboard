# The Hausdorff moment problem on the cube

`hausdorff_hildebrandt_schoenberg` is the Hausdorff–Hildebrandt–Schoenberg
theorem (1933): a multi-indexed real sequence is the moment sequence of a
signed bounded-variation Borel measure on the unit cube `Iᵈ = [0,1]ᵈ` iff it is
*Hausdorff bounded*. `hausdorff_positivity` is the Hausdorff positivity
criterion (1921): it comes from a *positive* finite measure iff it is completely
monotone (all iterated backward differences nonnegative).

A signed bounded-variation measure is encoded by its Jordan decomposition (a
difference of two finite positive measures); the moment integrals are taken over
the cube, so only the restriction to `Iᵈ` matters; the iterated backward
difference `Δᵏ` is given in closed form (the `ℕ`-subtraction `n − j` is genuine
in the `k ≤ n` regime the criteria use).

Mathlib has `SignedMeasure`, Jordan decomposition, finite measures, and set
integrals — enough to *state* the theorem — but no moment-problem machinery
(no Hausdorff/Hamburger/Stieltjes moment problem, no completely-monotone
sequences). The helper definitions below (`cube`, `monomial`, `momentOf`,
`IsMomentConfiguration`, `multiChoose`, `diff`, `HausdorffBounded`,
`IsPositiveMomentConfiguration`) are trusted (non-holes).

These are category-(b) candidates from §115 of the Knill survey
(`sections/115-moments.md`).
