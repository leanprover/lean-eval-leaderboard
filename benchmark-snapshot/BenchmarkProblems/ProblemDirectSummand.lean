# Direct summand conjecture and its derived variant

Hochster's direct summand conjecture states that any finite extension of a regular
commutative ring splits as a module, which was first proved by André in 2016.
Bhatt gave a quicker proof that circumvents the perfectoid Abhyankar lemma (André's
prior work) using a quantitative form of Scholze’s Hebbarkeitssatz (the Riemann
extension theorem) for perfectoid spaces. The same idea also leads to a proof of a
derived variant of the direct summand conjecture put forth by de Jong, which states
that if A is a regular (Noetherian) ring and X ⟶ Spec A is proper and surjective,
then A ⟶ RΓ(X, 𝒪_X) splits in the derived category D(A).
