# Nikolov–Segal strong completeness theorem

A profinite group is **strongly complete** when all of its finite-index subgroups are open.
Nikolov and Segal proved that every topologically finitely generated profinite group is strongly
complete. In particular, its topology is determined by its underlying abstract group structure.
