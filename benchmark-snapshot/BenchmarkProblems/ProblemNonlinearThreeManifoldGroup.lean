# A 3-manifold group with no faithful representation into GL(4, ℝ) (Button)

`[Kir97, Problem 3.33]`, due to W. Thurston, asks whether every finitely
generated 3-manifold group admits a faithful (injective) representation into
`GL(4, ℝ)`. This is true for hyperbolic 3-manifolds, but Button gave a negative
answer in general: the fundamental groups of certain closed graph manifolds
admit no faithful representation into `GL(4, k)` for *any* field `k` (J. O.
Button, *Aspherical 3-manifold groups not in `GL(4, k)`*, 2014).

We state the negative answer to Thurston's question over `ℝ`: there is a closed
connected 3-manifold whose fundamental group has no faithful representation into
`GL(4, ℝ)`. (Button's theorem is in fact stronger, ruling out every field.)

A closed connected topological 3-manifold is bundled as `Closed3Manifold`. The
statement is not vacuous: a simply connected witness would have trivial `π₁`,
whose unique map to `GL(4, ℝ)` is injective, contradicting the universal
non-injectivity — so the witness must genuinely have a non-linear fundamental
group.

Mathlib has `FundamentalGroup`, `GL`, `MonoidHom`, and `ChartedSpace`, but no
graph manifolds and none of the linearity obstructions (residual properties,
the structure theory of 3-manifold groups) Button's argument relies on.
